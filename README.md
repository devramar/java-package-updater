# Java Package Updater

I'll make a better readme one day

this repo is a buildable python script that navigates either your working directory or `--path`,
find any .java file,
and ensures its package is related to the tree its walked down.

very useful if you've moved some shit around.

one day i'll add a feature to set the initial path, so u can only update subfolders, but idc for that rn
