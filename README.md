# Java Package Updater

I'll make a better readme one day

this repo is a buildable python script that navigates either your working directory or `--path`,
finds any .java file, and ensures its package is related to the tree its walked down.

very useful if you've moved some shit around.

one day i'll add a feature to set the initial package-path, for more versatility, if i ever need it
